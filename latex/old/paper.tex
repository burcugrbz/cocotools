\section{Introduction}

\section{Review of continuation}

In this section we review the principle of parameter continuation and point out differences to conventional implementations.

\subsection{Setting up the system}

We are interested in families of solutions of the equation $F(x,\lambda)=0$, $F:\R^l \times \R^m \to \R^n$, where $l+m>n$, and want to trace a set of test functions $G(x,\lambda)$ along such families. Note that the above notation includes the traditionally considered cases $l=n$ and $m=0$. Even though these cases are equivalent we did not restrict our toolbox to one of those as to allow the user to choose her favourite problem formulation.

We construct a map $E:\R^m\to\R^n$ ($m$ and $n$ different from above) containing the equations $F$ and the test functions $G$:
\begin{equation*}
E(y):=\left[\begin{array}{l}
F(x,\lambda) \\
G(x,\lambda)-\mu
\end{array}\right] = 0,
\end{equation*}
where $y=(x,\lambda,\mu)$. The dimension of the family of solutions is $d=m-n$. For arc-length continuation we require $d=1$.

\subsection{1D-covering algorithm}

Throughout this section we assume that $E:\R^{n+1}\to\R^n$, that is, we look for one-dimensional families of solutions. The covering algorithm `sees' only equations that have one vector as input and one vector as output. The main purposees of this algorithm are to
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item amend these equations with a number of covering conditions to obtain a system of equations with a unique regular solution point,
\item perform prediction-correction steps to compute a covering of the solution manifold,
\item locate special points if test functions have been defined and
\item check for boundary conditions at which to terminate the continuation.
\end{enumerate}
%
The traditional way to implement the 1D covering algorithm is to perform prediction correction steps in one direction until a termination condition is met. This is not generalisable to higher-dimensional geometries. Hence, here we employ a framework that applies to covering algorithms for arbitray dimensional manifolds.

The basic idea is, starting with a single chart, to compute an atlas of a manifold $M$ within well-defined boundaries. A chart $\chi$ is here a tuple $\chi=(x,t)$ consisting of a point $x\in M$ on the manifold and some representation $t$ of the tangent space $T_x(M)$ at $x$. In the 1D case this is just a normalised tangent vector pointing in the direction of continuation. The algorithm now proceeds as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{0.9\textwidth}|}
\hline
cover\_manifold \\
\hline
I: chartlist $L = \{\chi_0\}$ \\
\hline
O: atlas $A$, special point list $S$ \\
\hline
Variables: chartlist $N$ of first order interior neighbours of charts in $L$, this list is necessary to prevent prediction into already computed regions \\
\hline
$A=L$ \\[0.2ex]
while not isempty($L$) \\
\hspace{2ex} pick a chart $(x,t)\in L$ \\
\hspace{2ex} compute $y\in t$ such that $(y,t)\cup L$ gives nice mesh (requires $N$) \\
\hspace{2ex} correct $(y,t)$ back to manifold \\
\hspace{2ex} check if point is acceptable $\longrightarrow$ handle cases when not \\
\hspace{2ex} if $(y,t)$ outside computational domain \\
\hspace{4ex}  	compute boundary chart $(y,t)$ \\
\hspace{2ex} end \\
\hspace{2ex} $A = A\cup(y,t)$ \\
\hspace{2ex} link $(y,t)$ to neighbouring charts in $L$ \\
\hspace{2ex} check for and compute all special points along these new links \\
\hspace{2ex} $S=S\cup{}$(new special points) \\
\hspace{2ex} move all interior charts from $L$ to $N$ \\
\hspace{2ex} remove all purely second order charts from $N$ \\
end \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}




\subsection{Locating special points}

Locating special points is part of the covering algorithm. Special points are most commonly co-dimension one, hence, the location is guided by the one-dimensional edges of the covering simplices.

Special points are points where one of the test function values $\mu$ assumes a user-defined value, most commonly, $\mu_i=0$. There are three types of special points, determined by their co-dimension and properties of $G_i$:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Co-dimension one and $G_i$ is twice continuously differentiable. This is the most common type of special point. The corresponding parameter $\mu_i$ is an active continuation parameter and the point is located by applying Newton's method to the extended system replacing the arc-length (covering) condition with $\mu_i-\mu_0=0$, where $\mu_0$ is the value that $\mu$ assumes at the special point.

\item Co-dimension one and $G_i$ is not twice continuously differentiable. This is the case, for example, for special points for which $G_i$ involves the computation of a maximum (supremum-norm). The point is located using subdivision along the line segment connecting the two successive points between which the special point was detected. The true arc of the manifold is interpreted as a graph over this line segment, which is parametrised by convex combination. The subdivision proceeds by computing a point on the branch using an extended system that replaces the arc-length (covering) condition with the condition that the point must lie in a hyperplane vertical to the line segment; see \figref{frank:fig1}.

\item Co-dimension one, but non-generic, that is, the `true' co-dimension is greater than one. The classical examples are bifurcation points (pitchfork and transcritical), which occur generically in systems with symmetries, but have co-dimension greater than one for generic systems. Such points cannot be located on the solution branch, because the Jacobian of any system extended with just one condition will become singular. These points are approximately located on the line segment connecting two sucessive points between which the special point was found. These points should serve as starting points for a post-processing that uses a suitable extended system/method.
\end{enumerate}
